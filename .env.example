# Copy this file to .env and customize the values

# ===== API CONFIGURATION =====
# URL of your EphemeralMail backend (without /api suffix)
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4444

# ===== EMAIL DOMAIN CONFIGURATION =====
# The domain used for email addresses (without @)
# This should match the DOMAIN environment variable in the backend

# Example 3: Backend on subdomain
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

#    ✅ Correct: VITE_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com

#    - GET https://yourdomain.com/api/health
#    - POST https://yourdomain.com/api/emails/generate

#    the domain where this frontend is served from

# 4. Backend must be running and accessible before starting frontend
